## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: GitHub Repository
- [ ] Push all changes to GitHub
- [ ] Ensure repository is public (for free Render/Netlify)
- [ ] Verify all files are included

### Step 2: Render Backend Deployment
- [ ] Create Render account
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Create new Web Service
- [ ] Configure settings:
  - [ ] Name: `gender-detection-api`
  - [ ] Environment: Python 3
  - [ ] Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - [ ] Start Command: `python server.py`
  - [ ] Plan: Free
- [ ] Deploy and wait for completion
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Note the backend URL

### Step 3: Netlify Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Create Netlify account
- [ ] Deploy frontend:
  - [ ] Option A: Drag & drop `frontend/dist/` folder
  - [ ] Option B: Connect GitHub repo with build settings
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  - [ ] Key: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
  - [ ] Value: Your Render backend URL
- [ ] Redeploy after environment variable changes
- [ ] Test the frontend application

### Step 4: Testing
- [ ] Test backend API endpoints
- [ ] Test frontend camera access
- [ ] Test gender detection functionality
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Functionality
- [ ] Backend responds to health checks
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Camera access works (HTTPS required)
- [ ] Gender detection API responds
- [ ] Real-time detection works
- [ ] Results display correctly

### âœ… Performance
- [ ] Backend loads models successfully
- [ ] Detection response time is acceptable
- [ ] Frontend loads quickly
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes

### âœ… Security
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on both services
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Input validation working

### âœ… Monitoring
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor Netlify analytics
- [ ] Set up health check monitoring
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Issues
- **Models not loading**: Check if model files are in repository
- **Memory errors**: Upgrade to paid Render plan
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout settings
- **CORS errors**: Verify CORS configuration

### Frontend Issues
- **API connection failed**: Check environment variable
- **Camera not working**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- **Build errors**: Check Node.js version compatibility
- **Styling issues**: Verify CSS is included in build

### Deployment Issues
- **Render deployment fails**: Check build logs
- **Netlify build fails**: Verify build command
- **Environment variables not working**: Redeploy after changes
- **Domain issues**: Configure custom domains properly

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Performance
- [ ] Upgrade Render to paid plan
- [ ] Reduce detection frequency
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Use CDN for static assets
- [ ] Optimize image sizes

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Render monitoring
- [ ] Configure Netlify analytics
- [ ] Add error tracking
- [ ] Set up alerts for downtime

## Cost Estimation

### Free Tier (Testing)
- Render: $0/month (with limitations)
- Netlify: $0/month (generous limits)
- **Total: $0/month**

### Paid Tier (Production)
- Render: $7-25/month
- Netlify: $19/month
- **Total: $26-44/month**

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Fine-tune the ViT model** for better accuracy
2. **Add user authentication** for production use
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Add analytics tracking** for usage insights
5. **Set up automated backups** of model files
6. **Create API documentation** for developers
7. **Add monitoring and alerting** for production
